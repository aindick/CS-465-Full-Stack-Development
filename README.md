# CS-465-Full-Stack-Development

Architecture

- Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).

  For this project, I was required to utilize MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node) for my web application. I used Express HTML to help with creating different web pages for the customer to interact with. JavaScript was used for the API controllers part of the web application. The controllers were quite necessary because they are what help with rendering the information for the user. I created a single-page application (SPA) made with Angular so that the admins could have their own simple and faster webpage for creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) the trip data easily. MongoDB was where the data was being stored from the trips and where login usernames and passwords were stored on the server side.
  
- Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

  I used MongoDB vs. an SQL database because MongoDB allows for unstructured data or structured and JSON formatting which is what I needed for this web application. MongoDB is also highly scalable, flexible, and faster to program.
  
Functionality

- How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?

  JSON is a data format while JavaScript is a programming language. JSON helped me to bridge the frontend and backend together because it structured the data and exchanged the data between the two. 
  
- Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

  During the development process, code refactoring is important for improving functionality and efficiency. For example, when I was working on 
  
Testing

- Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
