# CS-465-Full-Stack-Development

Architecture

- Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).

  For this project, I was required to utilize MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node) for my web application. I used Express HTML to help with creating different web pages for the customer to interact with. JavaScript was used for the API controllers part of the web application. The controllers were quite necessary because they are what help with rendering the information for the user. I created a single-page application (SPA) made with Angular so that the admins could have their own simple and faster webpage for creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) the trip data easily. MongoDB was where the data was being stored from the trips and where login usernames and passwords were stored on the server side.
  
- Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

  I used MongoDB vs. an SQL database because MongoDB allows for unstructured data or structured and JSON formatting which is what I needed for this web application. MongoDB is also highly scalable, flexible, and faster to program.
  
Functionality

- How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?

  JSON is a data format while JavaScript is a programming language. JSON helped me to bridge the frontend and backend together because it structured the data and exchanged the data between the two. 
  
- Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

  During the development process, code refactoring is important for improving functionality and efficiency. For example, when I was working on creating more web pages other than the travel page, I reused the code from the travel webpage components to construct the next pages. I made my time coding much easier since I was less prone to making errors since it was reused code.
  
Testing

- Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.

  For testing, I used Postman to help with checking the API endpoints such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. It's hard to tell on the frontend and backend if something is really working so Postman helps to test if requests are going through to the application. As I added more security to the application, it did add some difficulty to the testing aspect such as having to use a username and password to assess my website every time I want to test parts of it like the admin side.
  
Reflection

- How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

  This course has really opened my eyes to what full-stack is. I've always wanted to be a full-stack engineer since I began college but I never truly knew fully what encompassed full-stack engineering. MEAN though was something very important to learn since many companies follow the MEAN stack type of engineering, so that was a very valuable skill to take away from this class. I can't wait to start the next full-stack class next semester!
